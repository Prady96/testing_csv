===============

Developing openSource file converter that could detect tables and perfectly extract via PDF/Image
----

We started building from openSource python library available all around internet but none of them was perfect for all the requirements available in the market,

Therefore we are looking forward to develop a machine learning algorithem for perfect extraction and satisfying different use cases of PDFs and images for the direct conversion.

We like to keep it simple therefore we are not running it on the server rather than we have been focussing on developing a client side application.

We will be **Updating Soon new method for detection and Extraction**
